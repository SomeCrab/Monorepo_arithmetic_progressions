# Multi-repo arithmetic progression programming project @ Algorithms
This repo is part of my learning journey from Monolith to Monorepo architecure.(Monolith -> Multi-repo -> Monorepo)

While enjoing this journey, i will simulate some work on each step before i land to monorepo.

The code itself is actually just one part of my older Python hw.
